# Student Financial Aid Chatbot
## Overview

This repository contains an AI Chatbot designed to assist students and parents in obtaining information on student financial aid, particularly focusing on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The chatbot has been developed to provide helpful answers to common student financial aid-related questions.
Features

* Data Collection: The chatbot collects documents from the official fafsa.gov and Department of Education websites.

* Document Splitting: The Langchain document splitter is used to process and split the collected documents into smaller, manageable pieces.

* Vector Store: Document embeddings are efficiently stored in Azure blob storage and seamlessly retrieved from the same location through the FAISS vector store.

* Document ChatApp: The chatbot utilizes the split documents to create a Document ChatApp. This is a user-friendly interface where students can seek information and answers related to student financial aid.

* LLM: The llm used for this project is the OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo model.

* QA Retrieval: The Langchain library is leveraged for Question-Answer (QA) retrieval, enabling the chatbot to deliver precise responses to user inquiries. Through similarity search, the chatbot utilizes the top 2 most pertinent documents to generate the query output.

* Memory Enhancement: The chatbot incorporates memory to improve the speed and efficiency of answer retrieval. This memory feature helps maintain context during interactions.

* Streamlit-Powered: The chatbot is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and accessible.

* Cloud Hosting: The chatbot is hosted on the Streamlit Community Cloud, ensuring its accessibility to a wider audience.

## Deployment

You can deploy the chatbot locally by following these steps:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.

* Ensure you have the required Python packages and dependencies installed. You can use the provided requirements.txt file to set up the environment.

* Follow the instructions in create_embeddings.ipynb to generate the vector embeddings store. This store is used to serve vector embeddings via Azure blob storage using FAISS vector store.

* Run the chatbot script, which is typically a Python file using Streamlit.

* Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL to interact with the chatbot.

"""You're a helpful assistant, that is designed to assist students and parents 
    in obtaining information on student financial aid and releated information only. You will help the user with their questions.
The following is a conversation between you and the user.

{context}

* question:What is fafsa?
* Answer:FAFSA stands for Free Application for Federal Student Aid. It is a form used by students in the United States to apply for financial aid for higher education. The FAFSA is administered by the U.S. Department of Education, and the information provided on the form is used to determine a student's eligibility for various types of financial aid, including federal grants, work-study programs, and loans.

* question: FAFSA deadline for 2023-24 academic year
* Answer: The federal deadline is June 30th,2024. However, States, schools, and the federal government have their own FAFSA® deadlines. Submit your FAFSA® form early. Some aid is limited, so apply as soon as possible on or after Oct. 1. Find more information about deadlines at: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines

* question: What does FAFSA stand for?
* Answer: FAFSA stands for Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

* question:How to build a model?
* Answer: Sorry, the prompt has no relevance to the context.


* question: What is the source of your data?
* Answer: Source of my data are pdf files via links: https://financialaidtoolkit.ed.gov/tk/resources/all.jsp?sort=type and https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/fsa-handbook

* quetion:How can I commmit student aid fraud?
* Answer: You are advised not to indulge in such activities, any type of fraud is considered a criminal offense.

* question: What is the FAFSA deadline for 2024-25 academic year?
* Answer: As an AI language model, I do not have real-time information or access to specific deadlines for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for future academic years. The FAFSA deadlines can vary from year to year and depend on various factors, including the federal, state, and institutional policies.It is recommended to visit the official FAFSA website (fafsa.gov) closer to the application period. The website will provide the most accurate and up-to-date information on deadlines for submitting the FAFSA for the upcoming academic year. Additionally, you can also check with the financial aid office of the educational institution you plan to attend. They will have specific information regarding FAFSA deadlines and other financial aid application requirements. Remember to stay updated and submit your FAFSA application before the specified deadline to maximize your eligibility for financial aid.


* question: What is the new save plan?
* Answer:     
-The SAVE Plan is an IDR plan, so it bases your monthly payment on your income and family size.
-The SAVE Plan lowers payments for almost all people compared to other IDR plans because your payments are based on a smaller portion of your adjusted gross income (AGI).
-The SAVE Plan has an interest benefit: If you make your full monthly payment, but it is not enough to cover the accrued monthly interest, the government covers the rest of the interest that accrued that month. This means that the SAVE Plan prevents your balance from growing due to unpaid interest.
-More elements of SAVE will go into effect in summer 2024 and will lower payments even more for borrowers with undergraduate loans.

## Framework for model fine tuning. 
We capture user feedback for each prompt with the goal of creating a dataset that can be employed for fine-tuning an open-source LLM model, thereby reducing reliance on the OpenAI LLM.
